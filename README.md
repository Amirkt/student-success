### Predicting students' dropout and academic success 

#### Introduction and discovery:
A group of 4 creators created the dataset of this project from a higher education institution related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees. The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and socioeconomic factors) and the student’s academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. 
The problem (dependent variable) is formulated as a three-category classification task (dropout, enrolled, and graduate) at the end of the normal duration of the course.
My goal is to use machine learning algorithms to see if this dataset and its features can contribute to the reduction of academic dropout and failure in higher education and identify students at risk at an early stage of their academic path. 
So, if we succeed in identifying students at risk of failure, with this information, institutions can provide strategic services like tutoring teams to help students become successful.
